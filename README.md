# Tweet-Match
Hi, I am new to programming and this is my first project aiming to match people tweeting about similar topics with the help of LDA model. In each usage, the program appends the topics of the individual's tweets to the JSON file. And with the help of a basic scoring algorithm that I used people get matched with others based on those topics.
